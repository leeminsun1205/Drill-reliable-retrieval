# Local and Kaggle execution

## Intended workflow

Git is the source of truth. The normal workflow is:

1. develop and run lightweight checks locally;
2. commit and push the reproducible code and configuration;
3. clone or update the same repository in Kaggle;
4. attach the dataset through Kaggle inputs;
5. invoke repository scripts rather than reimplementing pipeline logic in the
   notebook;
6. save small metrics and provenance for later review, while keeping large
   embeddings and checkpoints outside Git.

Kaggle notebooks should be thin launchers: install dependencies, resolve input
and output paths, call scripts, and display or export results. Core research
logic belongs in `src/drill_ir/`.

## Hardware profiles

Experiments should expose hardware choices in configuration. Support at least:

```yaml
runtime:
  accelerator: auto       # cpu, cuda, or auto
  devices: auto           # 1, 2, or auto
  mixed_precision: false  # set explicitly per experiment
  batch_size: null        # stage-specific value should be recorded
  num_workers: 2
```

The preferred Kaggle profile should use both available NVIDIA T4 GPUs where the
stage benefits from parallelism. Likely candidates are corpus encoding,
cross-encoder training, and large reranking batches. BM25, data parsing, metric
calculation, and small inference jobs are normally CPU-bound or too small to
benefit and should not acquire GPUs unnecessarily.

Multi-GPU support must not silently change the scientific result. Preserve
input order and the mapping from vector positions to `aid`, gather distributed
outputs deterministically, avoid duplicate samples introduced by distributed
samplers, and record world size, per-device batch size, effective global batch
size, precision mode, GPU model, and runtime.

Use the simplest suitable strategy:

- independent data-parallel encoding/reranking shards for inference workloads;
- distributed data parallel for training when training is actually required;
- a deterministic single-GPU fallback for debugging and environments with one
  GPU;
- CPU fallback for correctness tests and stages that do not require CUDA.

Do not assume two GPUs are present merely because the config requests them.
Validate availability at startup and fail with a clear message or use an
explicitly configured fallback policy.

## Paths and portability

Do not hard-code Kaggle mount paths in core modules. Pass dataset, cache, model,
and output paths through CLI arguments or configuration. Environment-specific
path resolution may live in a thin notebook cell or launcher script.

The current Kaggle dataset locations are:

```text
/kaggle/input/datasets/lmnhnht125/wedev-vlsp/legal-corpus.parquet
/kaggle/input/datasets/lmnhnht125/wedev-vlsp/train.parquet
```

Store these values in a Kaggle-specific data config or CLI arguments, not as
defaults embedded in loaders. A local config can point to the future local
`datasets/` directory while invoking the same experiment command.

Corpus embeddings and model caches may be reused between runs when their
metadata matches the dataset checksum, preprocessing version, model identifier,
and relevant encoding configuration. Never reuse an unverified cache.
